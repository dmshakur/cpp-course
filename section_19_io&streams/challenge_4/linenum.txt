  80 	ROMEO AND JULIET

  82 	PROLOGUE


  85 	Two households, both alike in dignity,
  86 	In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
  87 	From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
  88 	Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
  89 	From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
  90 	A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
  91 	Whole misadventured piteous overthrows
  92 	Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
  93 	The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
  94 	And the continuance of their parents' rage,
  95 	Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
  96 	Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
  97 	The which if you with patient ears attend,
  98 	What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.




 103 	ROMEO AND JULIET


 106 ACT I



 110 SCENE I	Verona. A public place.


 113 	[Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet,
 114 	armed with swords and bucklers]

 116 SAMPSON	Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.

 118 GREGORY	No, for then we should be colliers.

 120 SAMPSON	I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.

 122 GREGORY	Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.

 124 SAMPSON	I strike quickly, being moved.

 126 GREGORY	But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

 128 SAMPSON	A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

 130 GREGORY	To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
 131 	therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.

 133 SAMPSON	A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
 134 	take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.

 136 GREGORY	That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
 137 	to the wall.

 139 SAMPSON	True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
 140 	are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
 141 	Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
 142 	to the wall.

 144 GREGORY	The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.

 146 SAMPSON	'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
 147 	have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
 148 	maids, and cut off their heads.

 150 GREGORY	The heads of the maids?

 152 SAMPSON	Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
 153 	take it in what sense thou wilt.

 155 GREGORY	They must take it in sense that feel it.

 157 SAMPSON	Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
 158 	'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.

 160 GREGORY	'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
 161 	hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
 162 	two of the house of the Montagues.

 164 SAMPSON	My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.

 166 GREGORY	How! turn thy back and run?

 168 SAMPSON	Fear me not.

 170 GREGORY	No, marry; I fear thee!

 172 SAMPSON	Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.

 174 GREGORY	I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
 175 	they list.

 177 SAMPSON	Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
 178 	which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

 180 	[Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR]

 182 ABRAHAM	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

 184 SAMPSON	I do bite my thumb, sir.

 186 ABRAHAM	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

 188 SAMPSON	[Aside to GREGORY]  Is the law of our side, if I say
 189 	ay?

 191 GREGORY	No.

 193 SAMPSON	No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
 194 	bite my thumb, sir.

 196 GREGORY	Do you quarrel, sir?

 198 ABRAHAM	Quarrel sir! no, sir.

 200 SAMPSON	If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.

 202 ABRAHAM	No better.

 204 SAMPSON	Well, sir.

 206 GREGORY	Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.

 208 SAMPSON	Yes, better, sir.

 210 ABRAHAM	You lie.

 212 SAMPSON	Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.

 214 	[They fight]

 216 	[Enter BENVOLIO]

 218 BENVOLIO	Part, fools!
 219 	Put up your swords; you know not what you do.

 221 	[Beats down their swords]

 223 	[Enter TYBALT]

 225 TYBALT	What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
 226 	Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.

 228 BENVOLIO	I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
 229 	Or manage it to part these men with me.

 231 TYBALT	What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
 232 	As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
 233 	Have at thee, coward!

 235 	[They fight]

 237 	[Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;
 238 	then enter Citizens, with clubs]

 240 First Citizen	Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
 241 	Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!

 243 	[Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET]

 245 CAPULET	What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!

 247 LADY CAPULET	A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?

 249 CAPULET	My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
 250 	And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

 252 	[Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]

 254 MONTAGUE	Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.

 256 LADY MONTAGUE	Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.

 258 	[Enter PRINCE, with Attendants]

 260 PRINCE	Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
 261 	Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
 262 	Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
 263 	That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
 264 	With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
 265 	On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
 266 	Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
 267 	And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
 268 	Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
 269 	By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
 270 	Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
 271 	And made Verona's ancient citizens
 272 	Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
 273 	To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
 274 	Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
 275 	If ever you disturb our streets again,
 276 	Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
 277 	For this time, all the rest depart away:
 278 	You Capulet; shall go along with me:
 279 	And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
 280 	To know our further pleasure in this case,
 281 	To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
 282 	Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

 284 	[Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO]

 286 MONTAGUE	Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
 287 	Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

 289 BENVOLIO	Here were the servants of your adversary,
 290 	And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
 291 	I drew to part them: in the instant came
 292 	The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
 293 	Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
 294 	He swung about his head and cut the winds,
 295 	Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
 296 	While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
 297 	Came more and more and fought on part and part,
 298 	Till the prince came, who parted either part.

 300 LADY MONTAGUE	O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
 301 	Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

 303 BENVOLIO	Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
 304 	Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
 305 	A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
 306 	Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
 307 	That westward rooteth from the city's side,
 308 	So early walking did I see your son:
 309 	Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
 310 	And stole into the covert of the wood:
 311 	I, measuring his affections by my own,
 312 	That most are busied when they're most alone,
 313 	Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
 314 	And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.

 316 MONTAGUE	Many a morning hath he there been seen,
 317 	With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
 318 	Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
 319 	But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
 320 	Should in the furthest east begin to draw
 321 	The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
 322 	Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
 323 	And private in his chamber pens himself,
 324 	Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
 325 	And makes himself an artificial night:
 326 	Black and portentous must this humour prove,
 327 	Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

 329 BENVOLIO	My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

 331 MONTAGUE	I neither know it nor can learn of him.

 333 BENVOLIO	Have you importuned him by any means?

 335 MONTAGUE	Both by myself and many other friends:
 336 	But he, his own affections' counsellor,
 337 	Is to himself--I will not say how true--
 338 	But to himself so secret and so close,
 339 	So far from sounding and discovery,
 340 	As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
 341 	Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
 342 	Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
 343 	Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
 344 	We would as willingly give cure as know.

 346 	[Enter ROMEO]

 348 BENVOLIO	See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
 349 	I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

 351 MONTAGUE	I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
 352 	To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.

 354 	[Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]

 356 BENVOLIO	Good-morrow, cousin.

 358 ROMEO	Is the day so young?

 360 BENVOLIO	But new struck nine.

 362 ROMEO	Ay me! sad hours seem long.
 363 	Was that my father that went hence so fast?

 365 BENVOLIO	It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

 367 ROMEO	Not having that, which, having, makes them short.

 369 BENVOLIO	In love?

 371 ROMEO	Out--

 373 BENVOLIO	Of love?

 375 ROMEO	Out of her favour, where I am in love.

 377 BENVOLIO	Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
 378 	Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

 380 ROMEO	Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
 381 	Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
 382 	Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
 383 	Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
 384 	Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
 385 	Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
 386 	O any thing, of nothing first create!
 387 	O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
 388 	Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
 389 	Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
 390 	sick health!
 391 	Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
 392 	This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
 393 	Dost thou not laugh?

 395 BENVOLIO	No, coz, I rather weep.

 397 ROMEO	Good heart, at what?

 399 BENVOLIO	At thy good heart's oppression.

 401 ROMEO	Why, such is love's transgression.
 402 	Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
 403 	Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
 404 	With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
 405 	Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
 406 	Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
 407 	Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
 408 	Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
 409 	What is it else? a madness most discreet,
 410 	A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
 411 	Farewell, my coz.

 413 BENVOLIO	                  Soft! I will go along;
 414 	An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

 416 ROMEO	Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
 417 	This is not Romeo, he's some other where.

 419 BENVOLIO	Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.

 421 ROMEO	What, shall I groan and tell thee?

 423 BENVOLIO	Groan! why, no.
 424 	But sadly tell me who.

 426 ROMEO	Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
 427 	Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
 428 	In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

 430 BENVOLIO	I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.

 432 ROMEO	A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.

 434 BENVOLIO	A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

 436 ROMEO	Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
 437 	With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
 438 	And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
 439 	From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
 440 	She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
 441 	Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
 442 	Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
 443 	O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
 444 	That when she dies with beauty dies her store.

 446 BENVOLIO	Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

 448 ROMEO	She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
 449 	For beauty starved with her severity
 450 	Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
 451 	She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
 452 	To merit bliss by making me despair:
 453 	She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
 454 	Do I live dead that live to tell it now.

 456 BENVOLIO	Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.

 458 ROMEO	O, teach me how I should forget to think.

 460 BENVOLIO	By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
 461 	Examine other beauties.

 463 ROMEO	'Tis the way
 464 	To call hers exquisite, in question more:
 465 	These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
 466 	Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
 467 	He that is strucken blind cannot forget
 468 	The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
 469 	Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
 470 	What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
 471 	Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
 472 	Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.

 474 BENVOLIO	I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

 476 	[Exeunt]

 484 ACT I



 488 SCENE II	A street.


 491 	[Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant]

 493 CAPULET	But Montague is bound as well as I,
 494 	In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
 495 	For men so old as we to keep the peace.

 497 PARIS	Of honourable reckoning are you both;
 498 	And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
 499 	But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?

 501 CAPULET	But saying o'er what I have said before:
 502 	My child is yet a stranger in the world;
 503 	She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
 504 	Let two more summers wither in their pride,
 505 	Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

 507 PARIS	Younger than she are happy mothers made.

 509 CAPULET	And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
 510 	The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
 511 	She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
 512 	But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
 513 	My will to her consent is but a part;
 514 	An she agree, within her scope of choice
 515 	Lies my consent and fair according voice.
 516 	This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
 517 	Whereto I have invited many a guest,
 518 	Such as I love; and you, among the store,
 519 	One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
 520 	At my poor house look to behold this night
 521 	Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
 522 	Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
 523 	When well-apparell'd April on the heel
 524 	Of limping winter treads, even such delight
 525 	Among fresh female buds shall you this night
 526 	Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
 527 	And like her most whose merit most shall be:
 528 	Which on more view, of many mine being one
 529 	May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
 530 	Come, go with me.

 532 	[To Servant, giving a paper]

 534 	Go, sirrah, trudge about
 535 	Through fair Verona; find those persons out
 536 	Whose names are written there, and to them say,
 537 	My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.

 539 	[Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS]

 541 Servant	Find them out whose names are written here! It is
 542 	written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
 543 	yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
 544 	his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
 545 	sent to find those persons whose names are here
 546 	writ, and can never find what names the writing
 547 	person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.

 549 	[Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO]

 551 BENVOLIO	Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
 552 	One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
 553 	Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
 554 	One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
 555 	Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
 556 	And the rank poison of the old will die.

 558 ROMEO	Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.

 560 BENVOLIO	For what, I pray thee?

 562 ROMEO	For your broken shin.

 564 BENVOLIO	Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

 566 ROMEO	Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
 567 	Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
 568 	Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.

 570 Servant	God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?

 572 ROMEO	Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

 574 Servant	Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
 575 	pray, can you read any thing you see?

 577 ROMEO	Ay, if I know the letters and the language.

 579 Servant	Ye say honestly: rest you merry!

 581 ROMEO	Stay, fellow; I can read.

 583 	[Reads]

 585 	'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
 586 	County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
 587 	widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
 588 	nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
 589 	uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
 590 	Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
 591 	Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
 592 	assembly: whither should they come?

 594 Servant	Up.

 596 ROMEO	Whither?

 598 Servant	To supper; to our house.

 600 ROMEO	Whose house?

 602 Servant	My master's.

 604 ROMEO	Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.

 606 Servant	Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
 607 	great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
 608 	of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
 609 	Rest you merry!

 611 	[Exit]

 613 BENVOLIO	At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
 614 	Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
 615 	With all the admired beauties of Verona:
 616 	Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
 617 	Compare her face with some that I shall show,
 618 	And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

 620 ROMEO	When the devout religion of mine eye
 621 	Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
 622 	And these, who often drown'd could never die,
 623 	Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
 624 	One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
 625 	Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

 627 BENVOLIO	Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
 628 	Herself poised with herself in either eye:
 629 	But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
 630 	Your lady's love against some other maid
 631 	That I will show you shining at this feast,
 632 	And she shall scant show well that now shows best.

 634 ROMEO	I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
 635 	But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

 637 	[Exeunt]

 645 ACT I



 649 SCENE III	A room in Capulet's house.


 652 	[Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse]

 654 LADY CAPULET	Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.

 656 Nurse	Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
 657 	I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
 658 	God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!

 660 	[Enter JULIET]

 662 JULIET	How now! who calls?

 664 Nurse	Your mother.

 666 JULIET	Madam, I am here.
 667 	What is your will?

 669 LADY CAPULET	This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
 670 	We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
 671 	I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
 672 	Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.

 674 Nurse	Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

 676 LADY CAPULET	She's not fourteen.

 678 Nurse	I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
 679 	And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
 680 	She is not fourteen. How long is it now
 681 	To Lammas-tide?

 683 LADY CAPULET	                  A fortnight and odd days.

 685 Nurse	Even or odd, of all days in the year,
 686 	Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
 687 	Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
 688 	Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
 689 	She was too good for me: but, as I said,
 690 	On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
 691 	That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
 692 	'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
 693 	And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
 694 	Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
 695 	For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
 696 	Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
 697 	My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
 698 	Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
 699 	When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
 700 	Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
 701 	To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
 702 	Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
 703 	To bid me trudge:
 704 	And since that time it is eleven years;
 705 	For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
 706 	She could have run and waddled all about;
 707 	For even the day before, she broke her brow:
 708 	And then my husband--God be with his soul!
 709 	A' was a merry man--took up the child:
 710 	'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
 711 	Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
 712 	Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
 713 	The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
 714 	To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
 715 	I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
 716 	I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
 717 	And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'

 719 LADY CAPULET	Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.

 721 Nurse	Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
 722 	To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
 723 	And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
 724 	A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
 725 	A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
 726 	'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
 727 	Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
 728 	Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'

 730 JULIET	And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.

 732 Nurse	Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
 733 	Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
 734 	An I might live to see thee married once,
 735 	I have my wish.

 737 LADY CAPULET	Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
 738 	I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
 739 	How stands your disposition to be married?

 741 JULIET	It is an honour that I dream not of.

 743 Nurse	An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
 744 	I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

 746 LADY CAPULET	Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
 747 	Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
 748 	Are made already mothers: by my count,
 749 	I was your mother much upon these years
 750 	That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
 751 	The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

 753 Nurse	A man, young lady! lady, such a man
 754 	As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.

 756 LADY CAPULET	Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

 758 Nurse	Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.

 760 LADY CAPULET	What say you? can you love the gentleman?
 761 	This night you shall behold him at our feast;
 762 	Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
 763 	And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
 764 	Examine every married lineament,
 765 	And see how one another lends content
 766 	And what obscured in this fair volume lies
 767 	Find written in the margent of his eyes.
 768 	This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
 769 	To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
 770 	The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
 771 	For fair without the fair within to hide:
 772 	That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
 773 	That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
 774 	So shall you share all that he doth possess,
 775 	By having him, making yourself no less.

 777 Nurse	No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.

 779 LADY CAPULET	Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?

 781 JULIET	I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
 782 	But no more deep will I endart mine eye
 783 	Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

 785 	[Enter a Servant]

 787 Servant	Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
 788 	called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
 789 	the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
 790 	hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.

 792 LADY CAPULET	We follow thee.

 794 	[Exit Servant]

 796 	Juliet, the county stays.

 798 Nurse	Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.

 800 	[Exeunt]




 805 	ROMEO AND JULIET


 808 ACT I



 812 SCENE IV	A street.


 815 	[Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six
 816 	Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others]

 818 ROMEO	What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
 819 	Or shall we on without a apology?

 821 BENVOLIO	The date is out of such prolixity:
 822 	We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
 823 	Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
 824 	Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
 825 	Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
 826 	After the prompter, for our entrance:
 827 	But let them measure us by what they will;
 828 	We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

 830 ROMEO	Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
 831 	Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

 833 MERCUTIO	Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

 835 ROMEO	Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
 836 	With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
 837 	So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

 839 MERCUTIO	You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
 840 	And soar with them above a common bound.

 842 ROMEO	I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
 843 	To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
 844 	I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
 845 	Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

 847 MERCUTIO	And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
 848 	Too great oppression for a tender thing.

 850 ROMEO	Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
 851 	Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.

 853 MERCUTIO	If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
 854 	Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
 855 	Give me a case to put my visage in:
 856 	A visor for a visor! what care I
 857 	What curious eye doth quote deformities?
 858 	Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.

 860 BENVOLIO	Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
 861 	But every man betake him to his legs.

 863 ROMEO	A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
 864 	Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
 865 	For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
 866 	I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
 867 	The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.

 869 MERCUTIO	Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
 870 	If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
 871 	Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
 872 	Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

 874 ROMEO	Nay, that's not so.

 876 MERCUTIO	I mean, sir, in delay
 877 	We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
 878 	Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
 879 	Five times in that ere once in our five wits.

 881 ROMEO	And we mean well in going to this mask;
 882 	But 'tis no wit to go.

 884 MERCUTIO	Why, may one ask?

 886 ROMEO	I dream'd a dream to-night.

 888 MERCUTIO	And so did I.

 890 ROMEO	Well, what was yours?

 892 MERCUTIO	That dreamers often lie.

 894 ROMEO	In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

 896 MERCUTIO	O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
 897 	She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
 898 	In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
 899 	On the fore-finger of an alderman,
 900 	Drawn with a team of little atomies
 901 	Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
 902 	Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
 903 	The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
 904 	The traces of the smallest spider's web,
 905 	The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
 906 	Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
 907 	Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
 908 	Not so big as a round little worm
 909 	Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
 910 	Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
 911 	Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
 912 	Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
 913 	And in this state she gallops night by night
 914 	Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
 915 	O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
 916 	O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
 917 	O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
 918 	Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
 919 	Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
 920 	Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
 921 	And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
 922 	And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
 923 	Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
 924 	Then dreams, he of another benefice:
 925 	Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
 926 	And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
 927 	Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
 928 	Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
 929 	Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
 930 	And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
 931 	And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
 932 	That plats the manes of horses in the night,
 933 	And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
 934 	Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
 935 	This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
 936 	That presses them and learns them first to bear,
 937 	Making them women of good carriage:
 938 	This is she--

 940 ROMEO	                  Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
 941 	Thou talk'st of nothing.

 943 MERCUTIO	True, I talk of dreams,
 944 	Which are the children of an idle brain,
 945 	Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
 946 	Which is as thin of substance as the air
 947 	And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
 948 	Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
 949 	And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
 950 	Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.

 952 BENVOLIO	This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
 953 	Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

 955 ROMEO	I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
 956 	Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
 957 	Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
 958 	With this night's revels and expire the term
 959 	Of a despised life closed in my breast
 960 	By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
 961 	But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
 962 	Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.

 964 BENVOLIO	Strike, drum.

 966 	[Exeunt]

 978 SCENE V	A hall in Capulet's house.


 981 	[Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins]

 983 First Servant	Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
 984 	shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!

 986 Second Servant	When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
 987 	hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.

 989 First Servant	Away with the joint-stools, remove the
 990 	court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
 991 	me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
 992 	the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
 993 	Antony, and Potpan!

 995 Second Servant	Ay, boy, ready.

 997 First Servant	You are looked for and called for, asked for and
